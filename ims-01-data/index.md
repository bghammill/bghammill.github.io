# Introduction to data

Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations - collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments - form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in the context of a general process of investigation:

1. Identify a question or problem.
2. Collect relevant data on the topic.
3. Analyze the data.
4. Form a conclusion.

In this tutorial, we focus on steps 1 and 2 of this process. In future tutorials, we will focus on steps 3 and 4 of this process.

## Learning objectives

- Internalize the language of data.
- Load and view a dataset in SAS and distinguish between various variable types and data representations.
- Classify a study as observational or experimental, and determine whether the studyâ€™s results can be generalized to the population and whether they suggest correlation or causation between the variables studied.
- Distinguish between various sampling strategies and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one strategy over another.
- Identify the principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes.
