# Regression modeling

Ultimately, data analysis is about understanding relationships among variables. Exploring data with multiple variables requires new, more complex tools, but enables a richer set of comparisons. In this tutorial, you will learn about regression techniques. You'll first learn about simple linear regression models, before moving on to multiple and logistic regression techniques. 

## Learning objectives

- Fit, interpret, and assess simple linear regression models
- Measure and interpret model fit
- Identify and attend to the disparate impact that unusual data observations may have on a regression model
- Compute and visualize model predictions
- Visualize, fit, interpret, and assess a variety of multiple regression models, including those with interaction terms
- Visualize, fit, interpret, and assess logistic regression models

## Lessons

### [Simple linear regression](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-03/)

- Visualize a simple linear model as “best fit” line
- Conceptualize simple linear regression
- Fit and describe simple linear regression models
- Internalize regression to the mean

### [Interpreting regression models](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-04/)

- Interpret the meaning of coefficients in a regression model
- Understand the impact of units and scales
- Make predictions from regression models
- Overlay a regression model on a scatterplot

### [Model fit](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-05/)

- Assess the quality of fit of a regression model
- Interpret $$R^2$$

### [Outliers in regression models](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-11/)

- Measure leverage and influence
- Identify and attend to outliers

### [Parallel slopes](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-06/)

- Visualize, fit, and interpret a parallel slopes model, which has one numeric and one categorical explanatory variable
- Describe a model in three different ways: mathematically, graphically, and through SAS syntax

### [Evaluating and extending the parallel slopes model](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-07/)

- Visualize, fit, and interpret a multiple regression model with two numeric explanatory variables
- Visualize, fit, and interpret a parallel planes model with two numeric explanatory variables and a categorical variable
- Fit and interpret multiple regression models in higher dimensions
- Understand and identify multicollinearity

### [Logistic regression](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-09/)

- Visualize, fit, and interpret logistic regression models
- Interpret coefficients 
- Make predictions from a logistic regression model

### [More on reference cell coding](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-12/)

- Incorporate categorical variables into regression models using reference cell coding
- Interpret coefficients based on reference cell coded variables

### [More on interaction](https://bghammill.github.io/ims-03-model/ims-03-lesson-13/)

- Interpret slope estimates from regression models that include interaction terms
