# Lesson 1

## Welcome

In the previous tutorials, you’ve learned how to describe the distribution of a single variable. This is useful, but in many cases, what we are more interested in is understanding the relationship between two variables.



## Visualizing two variables

In particular, in these tutorials you will learn techniques for characterizing and quantifying the relationship between two numeric variables.

In a statistical model, we generally have one variable that is the output and one or more variables that are the inputs. We will refer to the output variable as the response and we will denote it with the letter $$y$$. In other disciplines or contexts, you may hear this quantity called the dependent variable. More generally, the response variable is a quantity that we think might be related to the input or explanatory variable in some way. In other fields, these can be called “independent” or “predictor” variables. We typically denote any explanatory variables with the letter $$x$$. In these tutorials, we will focus on the case of a single explanatory variable. In the next tutorials, however, we will allow for several explanatory variables.

- *Response* variable
  - a.k.a. $$y$$, dependent
  - A variable you wish to understand
- *Explanatory* variable
  - a.k.a. $$x$$, independent, predictor
  - A variable you think might be related to the response
- Both variables are (continuous) *numerical*

### Graphical representations

Just as you learned to visualize the distribution of one variable with a histogram or density plot, statisticians have developed a commonly used framework for visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables: the scatterplot. The scatterplot has been called the most “[generally useful invention in the history of statistical graphics](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhbs.20078/abstract).” It is a simple two-dimensional plot in which the two coordinates of each dot represent the values of two variables measured on a single observation.

- Put the response variable on vertical axis
- Put the explanatory variable on horizontal axis

By convention, we always put the response variable on the vertical, or $$y$$-axis, and the explanatory variable on the horizontal, or $$x$$-axis.
