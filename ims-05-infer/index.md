# Statistical inference

This tutorial builds on statistical inference ideas we’ve learned about so far and applies them to different data scenarios. We will review how to conduct statistical inference in these scenarios using both simulation-based methods as well as mathematical methods based on the central limit theorem.
We will encounter several new point estimates and a couple new distributions. In each case, the inference ideas remain the same: determine which point estimate or test statistic is useful, identify an appropriate distribution for the point estimate or test statistic, and apply the ideas of inference.

## Learning objectives

- Construct a confidence interval on one proportion and the difference in two proportions.
- Interpret a confidence interval in the context of a particular data set.
- Conduct hypothesis tests for a single proportion and the difference in two proportions.
- Carry out a Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Test and a Chi-squared Test of Independence.
- Visualize the null distribution of a statistic and use it to calculate a p-value.
- Interpret a p-value in the context of a particular problem.
- Construct a confidence interval for a mean using both bootstrapping and the t-distribution.
- Construct a confidence interval for the difference between two means using both bootstrapping and the t-distribution.
- Conduct inference on means when samples are dependent.
- Interpret all results within the context of your data and your research question.

## Lessons

In each of the lessons below, you will learn how to (a) calculate a confidence interval and (b) perform a hypothesis test for the parameter of interest. Each of the lessons focuses on a different data scenario—one proportion, difference in two proportions, one mean, difference in two means, etc. We will introduce new statistics and distributions as needed.
